### 1. Developmental two-step task
This sequential decision-making task was originally described in [Decker et al. (2016)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797616639301?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed), and is based off of an adult task originally described in [Daw et al. (2011)](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(11)00125-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627311001255%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).

Participants make a series of sequential decisions to try to gain as much reward as possible. In this version, on each trial, participants first must select a spaceship, which then transports them to one of two planets where they can ask an alien for space treasure.

Please note: the tasks were designed to be hosted on [Pavlovia](https://pavlovia.org/). As such, they will not run locally unless the Pavlovia-specific code is commented out._ 

The jsPsych version of the task was originally coded by the [Niv Lab](https://nivlab.princeton.edu/) at Princeton, and adapted by the [Hartley Lab](https://www.hartleylab.org/) at NYU for use online with children, adolescents, and adults.
